This is a bit of a sandbox/template for my Open Embedded build
adventures and misadventures.  It contains a good template to
handle bringing in select layers using the AOSP repo tool to 
handle the layer pieces and it provides a few config/metadata
helps that make it easy to provide full-on board support build
sets for people instead of handing off just a BSP under OE
and then expecting people to be able to figure it out on their
own.  It is hoped that vendors and other projects will look
at this repo and arrive at similar solutions or that they'll
fork me here and make life easier for all.
