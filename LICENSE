There is the potential of multiple licenses being involved as a result of 
using this metadata set from this repository or archive file.  This is a
metadata set that drives the build of embedded Linux distributions and the
like, using Open Embedded bitbake buildsystem metadata.  As such, you should
take care and due dilligence to review those respective licenses through
the metadata to ensure you are properly within compliance of the terms
of all the respective licenses, which include LGPL, GPL, MPL, BSD and 
others in varying forms and versions.  The Open Embedded system will assist
in this, providing you a list of the claimed licenses from each of the piece
parts that get brought in on a build run.  It is up to you to verify that
those licenses are in play with your built project- and to ensrue you 
comply with the terms within and without on the same.

Having said this, the contents residing in this repository or archive file,
being mostly metadata and manifests is provided under the following license:
